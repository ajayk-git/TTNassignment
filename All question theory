1.How are inline and block elements different from each other?

Answer:
A block-level element always start on a new line and takes up full width available(stretches left and right as far as it can).
The <div></div> is a block level element.

A inline element always does not start on a new line and takes up as much as width necessary.
the <span></span> is a inline element.

2.Explain the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none

Answer:
display:none removes the element from the normal flow of the page, allowing other elements to fill in.

visibility:hidden leaves the element in the normal flow of the page such that is still occupies space.

3. Explain the clear and float properties.

Answer:
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The clear CSS property sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared) floating elements that precede it. The clear property applies to floating and non-floating elements.

4. explain difference between absolute, relative,fixed and static.

Answer:
Relative:
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of the relative-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
Absolute:
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor(instead of position relative to the viewport, like fixed)
However, if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestor, it uses the document body and moves along with page scrolling.
FIXED:
An element with position: fixed; is position relative to the viewport, which means it stays at the same place even if the page is scrolled.
Static:
An element with position: static; is not positioned in a special away but it is positioned according to the flow of the page:
They are not affected by properties like top, bottom, left, and right.
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

6. Why do we use meta tags?

Answer:
Metadata is data about data.
The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.
Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata.
The meta tag is used for the viewport i.e. user's visible area of the webpage.
Syntax:
 <meta name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0">
where width=device-width is the full width of the device we are working on.

7. Explain box model.  

Answer:All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
Explanation of the different parts:

    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

8. What are the different types of CSS Selectors?

->Each page can have only one element with that ID
Syntax:
#id {property: value}
2.Classes are NOT unique
->You can use the same class on multiple elements.
->You can use multiple classes on the same element.
Syntax:
.class {property: value}

10. Explain 5 HTML5 semantic tags.
Answer:
1.<article> - Defines an article in the document

The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

Potential sources for the <article> element:

    Forum post
    Blog post
    News story
    Comment

2.<aside> - Defines content aside from the page content like sidebar.

The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.

3.<footer> - Defines a footer for the document or a section

The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element.

4.<header> - Defines a header for the document or a section

The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A <header> element typically contains:

    one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
    logo or icon
    authorship information

You can have several <header> elements in one document.

A <header> tag cannot be placed within a <footer> or another <header> element.

5.<nav> - Defines navigation links in the document

NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.
